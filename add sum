class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a[]={1,3,6,8,9};
      int i=0,j=a.length-1;
      int sum=7;
      while(i<=j)
      {
          if(a[i]+a[j]>7)
          j--;
          if(a[i]+a[j]<7)
          i++;
          else if(a[i]+a[j]==7){
          System.out.println("i"+i+"j"+j);
              break;
          }
          
      }
      
      
      With this, we can design the following algorithm:

We keep 2 pointers: l, starting at the first element of the array, and r starting at to the last.
If the sum of a[l] + a[r] is smaller than our target, we increment l by one (to change the smallest operand in the addition for another one equal or larger than it at l+1); if it is larger than the target, we decrease r by one (to change our largest operand for another one equal or smaller at r-1).
We do this until a[l] + a[r] equals our target or l and r point to the same element (since we cannot use the same element twice) or have crossed, indicating there is no solution.
